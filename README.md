It was a pretty interesting task, to create an interactive quiz-like layout using HTML, CSS and JS. 

I started by making the html structure and noting down the questions. One of the challenges i faced was how to more questions after user answers one set of quiz, I overcame this challenge by creating an key:value pair in JS in a group of 4 pairs of such question answers, repeated this 8 times and I got 8 questions.   


Another challenge faced was how to match the value of the progress bar to the current question, this was resolved by changing the quantity of "value" to match with currentQuestion variable, with a max limit of number of questions answered, this made the prograss bar to smoothly sync with flow of user of answering questions.
